                  Computer: an electronic device for processing, storing and

                <dd>
                  We humans use languages to communicatied with eachother, but
                  all of our languages fails to communicate with a computer, so
                  how to talk with a computer, first we have to learn the
                  language that computer understands, computer understands and
                  talks only in binary language. Binary lanugage is a set of two
                  values (0's and 1's) a single value in binary language is
                  called a bit. The smallest value that a processor in computer
                  holds is a 0 (off) or 1 (on). A 1 bit system uses combination
                  of numbers upto one place value(1), there are just two options
                  0 or 1, so with that we can represent only 0 or 1. A 2 bit
                  system uses combination of numbers upto two place values (11),
                  there are four options (00, 01, 10, 11), with that we can
                  represent numbers 0, 1, 2, 3. A 3 bit system uses combinaiton
                  of numbers upto three place values (111) and there are eight
                  options (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111), with that we
                  can represent 8 numbers, count starts from 0 to 7. A 8 bit
                  system uses combination of numbers upto 8 place value
                  (11111111), there are 256 options available with that so we
                  can represent numbers starting from 0 and ending to 255 and 8
                  bit system is called 1 byte, 1024 bytes is called 1kb or 1
                  kilobyte, 1024kb is 1 mb or 1 megabyte and so on. Each time by
                  increasing the bit number by 1 we get the values of
                  combination doubled and it can grow to an unimaginable number
                  very quick. A 32 bit system holds 4,294,967,296 (4 billion)
                  unique combinaitons of 0s and 1s but a 64 bit system is just
                  gigantic it holds 18,446,744,073,709,600,000 (18 quintillion).
                  Thats why modern computers are build on 64 bit architecture to
                  process huge amounts of calculations, gamings and graphic
                  works.

                <dt>What is Internet</dt>
                <dd>
                  Internet: A technology which enables computer to talk to
                  eachother over a network, a network is just wires connected to
                  eachother. Think it like this, internet is just a wire which
                  connects two or more computers and let them communicate with
                  each other through a specific set of rules known as Internet
                  Proctocol Suite (TCP/IP).
                </dd>
                <dd>
                  The internet began as ARPANET, an academic research network
                  that was funded by the militarys Advanced Research Projects
                  Agency (ARPA, now DARPA). The next generation of networking
                  standards for the ARPANET, known as TCP/IP, became the
                  foundation of the modern internet. During the 80s, funding for
                  the internet shifted from the military to the National Science
                  Foundation. The NSF funded the long-distance networks that
                  served as the internets backbone from 1981 until 1994. In
                  1994, the Clinton Administration turned control over the
                  internet backbone to the private sector. It has been privately
                  operated and funded ever since.

                <dt>Who runs the internet?</dt>
                <dd>
                  No one runs the internet. It is organized as a decentralized
                  network of networks. Thousands of companies, universities,
                  governments, and other entities operate their own networks and
                  exchange traffic with each other based on voluntary
                  interconnection agreements. The shared technical standards
                  that make the internet work are managed by an organization
                  called the Internet Engineering Task Force. The IETF is an
                  open organization; anyone is free to attend meetings, propose
                  new standards, and recommend changes to existing standards. No
                  one is required to adopt standards endorsed by the IETF, but
                  the IETF’s consensus-based (general agreement) decision-making
                  process helps to ensure that its recommendations are generally
                  adopted by the internet community. The Internet Corporation
                  for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is sometimes described
                  as being responsible for internet governance. As its name
                  implies, ICANN is in charge of distributing domain names (like
                  vox.com) and IP addresses. But ICANN doesn’t control who can
                  connect to the internet or what kind of information can be
                  sent over it.

                <dt>What’s an IP address?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Internet Protocol addresses are numbers that computers use to
                  identify each other on the internet. An IP address is a string
                  of numbers separated by periods. IP addresses are expressed as
                  a set of four numbers — an example address might be
                  192.158.1.38. Each number in the set can range from 0 to 255.
                  So, the full IP addressing range goes from 0.0.0.0 to
                  255.255.255.255. IP addresses are not random. They are
                  mathematically produced and allocated by the Internet Assigned
                  Numbers Authority (IANA), a division of the Internet
                  Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).

                <dd>
                  The Internet protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, is the
                  set of communications protocols used in the Internet and
                  similar computer networks. The current foundational protocols
                  in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and
                  the Internet Protocol (IP), as well as the User Datagram
                  Protocol (UDP), we will not discuss here the UDP.

                  Lets go through the above diagram from top to bottom and
                  understand how it works, you want to send a message to your
                  friends computer, you open an application, after that you
                  compose your message and send to your friend. Now the
                  application layer will connect to TCP and send your data to
                  TCP, when this data reachs TCP layer the TCP layer breaks down
                  the data into manageable chunks referred as packets and every
                  packets get assigned two port numbers 1 for sender and other
                  for receiver, after that the packet go through IP layer here
                  the packet gets its destinaiton IP address which is your
                  friends computer address, and finally the packet go through
                  Hardware Layer now the data in packet will be converted into
                  binary data and it starts its journey through the cables to
                  the destination computer. When it reaches its destinaiton the
                  packet goes bottom to top through every layer and your friend
                  can read the message you sent as "hello how are you".

                <dt>What is the World Wide Web?</dt>
                <dd>
                  The World Wide Web is a popular way to publish information on
                  the internet. The web was created by Timothy Berners-Lee, a
                  computer programmer at the European scientific research
                  organization CERN, in 1991. It offered a more powerful and
                  user-friendly interface than other internet applications. The
                  web supported hyperlinks, allowing users to browse from one
                  document to another with a single click. Over time, the web
                  became increasingly sophisticated, supporting images, audio,
                  video, and interactive content. In the mid-1990s, companies
                  such as Yahoo and Amazon.com began building profitable
                  businesses based on the web. In the 2000s, full-featured
                  web-based applications such as Yahoo Maps and Google Docs were
                  created. In 1994, Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web
                  Consortium (W3C) to be the web’s official standards
                  organization. He is still the W3C’s director and continues to
                  oversee the development of web standards. However, the web is
                  an open platform, and the W3C can’t compel anyone to adopt its
                  recommendations. In practice, the organizations with the most
                  influence over the web are Microsoft, Google, Apple, and
                  Mozilla, the companies that produce the leading web browsers.
                  Any technologies adopted by these four become de facto web
                  standards. The web has become so popular that many people now
                  regard it as synonymous with the internet itself. But
                  technically, the web is just one of many internet
                  applications.
